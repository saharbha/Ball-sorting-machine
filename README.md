# Ball-sorting-machine

## Purpose

The purpose of this machine is to sort a set of balls according to their weight. The balls are placed in a release mechanism  which allows them to be released into the tubes. Once they reach the seesaw a comparison will take place which means the heavier ball will be sent into one tube and the lighter one to another. At the end the balls arrive in ''huts'' and are lined up and sorted.

During the design process different problems  must be taken into consideration and solved :


- Problem 1: Construction of the seesaws: the heavier ball can arrive on any one of the seesaw sides, it must however leave again towards the exit of the same track. 

- Problem 2: The sorting process must not start before both balls are in place. Otherwise, the first ball that arrives will be considered to be the heavier, and the second will not be any more in circuit. 

- Problem 3: It is very important that the technical solutions are  simple enough so that the mechanical automatic aspect of this sorting remains visible. 

The machine is composed of 3 main parts: 

1. [The release mechanism](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/1.Release-mechanism)

2. [The balance](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/2.The-balance): The placement of the balances is not relative. 

3. [The container](https://github.com/saharbha/Ball-sorting-machine/wiki/3.-The-container)

## Background information

The first steps of the development of the sorting machine have been made in a workshop of the IMAGINARY conference 2016
> IMAGINARY is a platform for open and interactive mathematics. It features a variety of content that can be used in schools, at home, in museums, at exhibitions or for events and media activities. The main contents of IMAGINARY are its interactive programs and its picture galleries.

## Problem statement
IMAGINARY strives to develop open source exhibition material related to mathematics. The challenge of the Ball Sorting Machine is to illustrate the concept of sorting algorith with physical exhibition material.

An algorithm is a way to solve a problem without refection, mechanically. Sorting algorithms are good examples to show that to the general public: a mechanical machine should be able to sort balls from the heaviest to the lightest. The idea is to propose an installation which allows to sort balls mechanically, from the lightest to the heaviest. For 8 balls of different weights, the idea is to build a lap with ramps and bascules, in order to sort the balls at the end. The machine should be able to illustrate different sorting algorithms (e.g. quick sort, insert sort)
